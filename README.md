## What is GoidaPhone NT Server 1.8?

GoidaPhone NT Server 1.8 is a **fully encrypted, serverless peer-to-peer messenger** for local networks and VPN. Every message is end-to-end encrypted using modern cryptography. There are no central servers — your data never leaves your network.

Built with Python and PyQt6, it runs on Linux and Windows with a polished, themeable interface that rivals commercial messengers.

> **NT Server 1.8 is a complete protocol rewrite.** It is **not compatible** with older GoidaPhone versions (0.1 – 1.7544). Those versions use a fundamentally different, unencrypted protocol. NT Server 1.8 is a new ecosystem.

## Usage

### Connecting to others

GoidaPhone automatically discovers peers on the **same LAN or VPN**:

- **Same Wi-Fi / LAN network** → peers appear automatically, no configuration needed
- **Different networks** → use a VPN: [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/), [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/), [Hamachi](https://vpn.net/)

### First Run

1. Launch `gdf.py`
2. Complete the **Quick Setup Wizard** (name, theme, sounds)
3. Go through the **Tutorial** (or skip — it's available anytime in Help → Tutorial)
4. Start chatting

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/poll "Question?" Option1 Option2` | Create a live poll |
| `/ttl 60` | Set message auto-delete timer (seconds) |
| `/ttl 0` | Disable auto-delete |
| `/me action` | Sends *username action* |
| `/help` | Show all commands |

---

## Network Protocol

```
PROTOCOL_VERSION = 3
COMPAT_VERSION   = 2   (minimum accepted)

Transport:  UDP (broadcast discovery) + TCP (file transfer)
Port:       17385 (UDP) / 17386 (TCP)  — configurable

Handshake:  X25519 ECDH → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM session key
Signing:    Ed25519 identity key signs every packet
Nonces:     12-byte random per message (2^96 space)
Auth tag:   16-byte GCM tag (tampering → instant reject)
```

> **Compatibility note:** GoidaPhone 0.1 – 1.7544 use a completely different unencrypted protocol and **cannot communicate** with NT Server 1.8. NT Server 1.8 is a separate ecosystem.
